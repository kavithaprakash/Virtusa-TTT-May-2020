  <p>The purpose of V-carpooling is the sharing of car journey so that more than one person/employee can travel in a car. The greatest advantage of carpooling is the feeling of relaxation while reaching to office. You donâ€™t need to struggle all the way driving to office and feel relaxed - No Parking / Traffic tensions. The feeling of relaxation rejuvenates you to start your work natural fresh. And also Carpooling reduces the costs involved in car travel by sharing journey expenses between the employees travelling. Carpooling is also seen as a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys reduces carbon emissions, traffic on the roads, and the need for parking spaces. So it builds virtual relationships in our organization among the people commuting.
    Our top priority in building this application is the location tracking with high performance and user experience. In addition to this, we need to add a good recommendation engine to both web and mobile apps to improve our customer base with an enriched customer experience.
         In this V-carpooling any virtusan who own a car can offer to share his/her car. And any other virtusan who wants to use this service can search for journey through this portal. After finding a match they will contact and carry out their journey as planned
